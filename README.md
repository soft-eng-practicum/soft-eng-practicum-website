## Org Github Pages Website using Jekyll ##

Change these files to update the documentation served
[here](https://soft-eng-practicum.github.io/).

Here's the [Github repo
metadata](https://help.github.com/articles/repository-metadata-on-github-pages/)
we can use in the use in the pages.

To build and run the documentation locally, do:

```bash
$ bundle exec jekyll serve --watch
```

More info can be found at [the Github Pages setup](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/).

And here are the [Markdown help](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), [Sass guide](http://sass-lang.com/guide), and [Jekyll docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/usage/).

To add content, either add new files under `_posts/` or define
collections in `_config.yml` and add a corresponding folder structure
like that in `_itec3870_fa16/`.

### TODO ###

* Make individual pages for each project by using `@include index.md`
  and then picking up the item with a parameter?
* Upload the screencast videos to Youtube and link them from here.
